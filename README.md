# My i3 config
This is my i3 config. It's mostly the standart with some copyed stuff from [Benjamin Kaiser](http://blog.kaiserapps.com/2014/02/my-killer-i3-setup.html) on his [killer i3 config](https://github.com/benkaiser/i3-wm-config).  
I will not document it, just keep it available, it's very simple.
